		  <p>In Peruvian culture, huaca is a term commonly used to describe archaeological sites, but it’s more complex than that. Even though most peruvians think of a huaca as a tall stone pyramid, the word's definition is actually much broader.</p>
		  <p>"Huaca is also an adjective. You can be huaca and have the condition,” said Jaime Luis Castillo Butters, archaeology professor and Vice Minister of Cultural Patrimony and Cultural Industries.  “Huaca is the name that we give basically to all remnants of ancient societies and cultures.</p>
		  <p>Peru is known as the land of the Inca but it's also home to more than 25 earlier cultures, each with its own rituals, traditions and languages. Three of these cultures, The Lima, Wari and Ichma, all left behind huacas in what is now Peru’s capital city. These archaeological ruins hold clues to understanding people who once walked Lima’s streets.</p>

          <p>Though contemporary Peruvians can literally walk by history, many of their ancestor's secrets lie hidden beneath layers of dirt and rock that have formed over time. This is because most huacas aren't fully excavated. Instead they look like mounds of dirt,  mostly unguarded and only sometimes fenced.</p>
		  <p>The huacas are not concentrated in one part of Lima. Rather, huacas can be found across Lima. We visited 14 huacas in seven districts.</p>

			<p>Some huacas are well preserved while others showed signs of destruction.</p> 
			<p>The oldest standing huaca in Lima, Huaca Paraiso, dates back to about 4500 B.C. But even that one isn't safe. In July 2013, one of its 12 pyramids was destroyed. Since then, the government has increased security at the site to protect the huaca, but its size makes it difficult to monitor.</p> 
			<p>The site covers many 50 hectares, making it roughly the size of 95 football fields. Most of the site has not been excavated and is in what is called a "basural" stage in Spanish.</p>

			<p>Like El Paraiso, a majority of Lima’s huacas remain unexcavated due to lack of government funding. Even if the government had the resources to protect them, a majority of Lima’s huacas are located on land that is privately owned.</p> 
			<p>According to statistics from the Peruvian Ministry of Culture, 60 percent of the huacas in Lima are classified as threatened. Details about the precise condition of these approximately 220 endangered huacas are largely unknown. These unsecure sites lack protective fencing, police supervision and other basic security features.</p>

          <p>But it’s not always that simple because these problems interact with one another across the city.</p>
		  <p>Leck Morales Molano is a security guard at the Mateo Salado archaeological complex. He grew up near the ruins and remembers coming biking on the site before excavations began in 2007. To him and his friends, the huaca simply looked like a good spot for mountain biking. Since beginning his position as a security guard, however, he’s changed his mind and has begun to see the value of the place.</p> 
		  <p>He’s seen that shift in his community as well as more neighborhood residents have come for free tours and programs such as art classes and clown performances. This interaction and awareness has also translated into safer evenings for Morales. While people used to sneak in and do drugs at the huaca they have stopped coming for the most part now that there is an increased security presence.</p>

				  The Peruvian Ministry of Culture started restoring Mateo Salado in 2007. Since then, three of the site's five pyramids have been restored. However, the Ministry of Culture has said that the restoration project will not affect the people who had previously invaded the site and built homes there. They will be allowed to keep their housing structures.

			<p>Sonia Macedo Oliveira has been living at one of the huacas, Huaca de Armatambo for 36 years.</p>
			<p>“I moved here out of necessity,” she said of her decision to create a makeshift home next to the ruins. “I’m a warrior woman and I’ve been mother and father for my kids.”</p>
			<p>Macedo is a single mother  who spends her nights collecting and selling recycling. Her home is set up inside the protective fence that surrounds the huaca. Oliveira lives with her son and grandchildren as well as a group of chickens that provide her with eggs. She pays neighbors that live across the street to use their electricity and water.</p>
