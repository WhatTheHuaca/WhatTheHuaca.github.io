		  <p>In Peruvian culture, huaca is a term commonly used to describe archaeological sites, but it's more complex than that. Even though most Peruvians think of a huaca as a tall stone pyramid, the word's definition is actually much broader.</p>
		  <p>"Huaca is also an adjective. You can be huaca and have the condition, said Jaime Luis Castillo Butters, archaeology professor and Vice Minister of Cultural Patrimony and Cultural Industries.  Huaca is the name that we give basically to all remnants of ancient societies and cultures.</p>
		  <p>Peru is known as the land of the Inca but it's also home to more than 25 earlier cultures, each with its own rituals, traditions and languages. Three of these cultures, the Lima, Wari and Ichma, all left behind huacas in what is now Peru's capital city. These archaeological ruins hold clues to understanding the people who once walked Lima's streets.</p>

          <p>Though contemporary Peruvians can literally walk by ancient history, many of their ancestors' secrets remain hidden beneath layers of dirt and rock that have formed over time. This is because most huacas aren't fully excavated. Instead they look like mounds of dirt, mostly unguarded and only sometimes fenced.</p>
		  <p>The huacas are not concentrated in one part of Lima. Rather, huacas can be found across the city. We visited 14 huacas in seven districts.</p>

			<p>Some huacas are well preserved while others show signs of destruction.</p> 
			<p>Huaca El Paraiso, which is widely regarded as the oldest huaca in Lima, dates back to about 4000 B.C. But even that one isn't safe. In July 2013, one of its 12 pyramids was destroyed. Since then, the government has increased security at the site to protect the huaca, but its size makes it difficult to monitor.</p> 
			<p>The site covers many 50 hectares, making it roughly the size of 95 football fields. Most of the site is in what is called a "basural" stage in Spanish, meaning it has not been excavated.</p>

			<p>Like El Paraiso, a majority of Lima's huacas remain unexcavated due to lack of government funding. Even if the government had the resources to protect them, a majority of Lima's huacas are located on land that is privately owned.</p>

Details about the precise condition of these approximately 220 endangered huacas are largely unknown.

          <p>These problems interact with one another across the city.</p>
		  <p>Leck Morales Molano is a security guard at the Mateo Salado archaeological complex. He grew up near the ruins and remembers biking on the site before excavations began in 2007. To him and his friends, the huaca simply looked like a good spot for mountain biking. Since beginning his position, however, he's changed his mind and has begun to see the value of the place.</p> 
		  <p>He's seen that shift in his community as well as more neighborhood residents have come for free tours and programs such as art classes and clown performances. This interaction and awareness has also translated into safer evenings for Morales. While people used to sneak in and do drugs at the huaca they have stopped coming for the most part now that there is an increased security presence.</p>

				  The Peruvian Ministry of Culture started restoring Mateo Salado in 2007. Since then, three of the site's five pyramids have been restored. However, the Ministry of Culture has said that the restoration project will not affect the people who had previously invaded the site and built homes there. They will be allowed to keep their housing structures for the time being.

I have sweeped.” Oliveira maintains that she hasn’t damaged the huaca even though much of her home is up against the ruins. "Now that it's clean, people say it's a huaca but not before."
